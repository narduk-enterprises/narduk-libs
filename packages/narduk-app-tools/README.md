# @narduk-enterprises/narduk-app-tools

Focused app-local tooling exposed as `narduk-app`. It operates on the current
application only: local development, source-owned D1 migrations, guarded
Wrangler deployment, registry authentication, diagnostics, performance budgets,
and favicon assets.

## Migration config

`narduk-app db migrate` accepts a JSON config with explicit source names and
versions. Paths are relative to the config file:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "@narduk-enterprises/narduk-core",
      "dir": "node_modules/@narduk-enterprises/narduk-core/runtime/drizzle"
    },
    {
      "id": "@narduk-enterprises/narduk-auth",
      "dir": "node_modules/@narduk-enterprises/narduk-auth/drizzle"
    },
    {
      "id": "app",
      "dir": "drizzle"
    }
  ],
  "adoptions": []
}
```

Package sources are applied before `app`. The ledger uses `(source, filename)`
as its primary key and stores the SHA-256 SQL checksum. Existing ambiguous rows
are refused unless an adoption entry names the exact target checksum and proves
the expected schema tables, columns, and indexes. A migration and its ledger row
are submitted in the same D1 batch so a failed statement rolls back the batch.

Before any remote mutation, the command fails closed unless it can capture a D1
Time Travel bookmark, current migration ledgers, and `sqlite_master` metadata.
The mode-`0600` recovery artifact is written under `.narduk/recovery/d1/` and
its path is printed by the CLI. Remote reset is never supported; corrective
database changes are forward-only.

App Worker configuration may use `wrangler.jsonc` (preferred) or legacy
`wrangler.json`. All Wrangler calls run through the app's pinned dependency via
`pnpm exec wrangler`.

The command never writes secret files. Registry auth writes the requested
`.npmrc.auth` path and scopes GitHub Packages only to `@narduk-enterprises`;
`@loganrenz` remains on the public npm registry.
