# @narduk-enterprises/narduk-testkit

Dev-only Vitest factories, Playwright fixtures/contracts, and UI-quality tools
for Narduk apps. The published package contains built ESM and declarations; it
has no Nuxt layer, Nuxt configuration, auto-merged files, or aliases.

The root, `e2e/*`, and `playwright/*` exports belong to the Playwright runner.
The `server/kit/*` exports belong to the Vitest runner. Import each family only
from its owning test process because both runners install their own matcher
globals.

Apps own their Vitest and Playwright configuration. Import a factory from an
explicit subpath and call it from a thin app-local test wrapper:

```ts
import { registerCanonicalHostMiddlewareTests } from '@narduk-enterprises/narduk-testkit/server/kit/canonical-host'

registerCanonicalHostMiddlewareTests(
  () =>
    import('@narduk-enterprises/narduk-core/server/middleware/00-canonical-host'),
)
```

Playwright discovery wrappers can import the fixture, contract, and spec
subpaths directly:

```ts
import { defineSharedAuthContract } from '@narduk-enterprises/narduk-testkit/e2e/contracts/auth'
import { test } from '@narduk-enterprises/narduk-testkit/e2e/fixtures'

defineSharedAuthContract({ appName: 'my-app' })
void test
```

Apps whose users endpoint is not the default `/api/admin/users` can configure
the reusable API spec without copying it:

```ts
import { registerUsersApiSpec } from '@narduk-enterprises/narduk-testkit/e2e/specs/users-api'

registerUsersApiSpec({ apiPath: '/api/users' })
```

The UI-quality analyzer is also available as a small binary:

```sh
narduk-testkit ui analyze output/playwright/visual-audit
```

Playwright and Vitest are peer dependencies so each app controls its test runner
version. The analyzer uses `sharp` as a package runtime dependency.
